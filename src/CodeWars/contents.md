### 1) Breaking chocolate problem
###### Site Difficulty: 7 kyu / Perceived difficulty: Trivial
Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.
#### Personal notes:
All you have to do is create/guess the formula and return it.
### 2) Roman Numerals Helper
###### Site Difficulty: 4 kyu / Perceived difficulty: Medium
Write two functions that convert a roman numeral to and from an integer value.
Multiple roman numeral values will be tested for each function.
### Personal notes:
The difficulty is pouring a set of steps already internally understood into a formal algorithm.
After a bit of trial and error I came up with a backwards-subtractive and an iterative approach.
