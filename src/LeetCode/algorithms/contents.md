### 1) Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
###### Site Difficulty: Medium / Perceived difficulty: Easy
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
#### Personal notes:
Easy problem, simple solution.
### 2) Add two numbers
###### Site Difficulty: Medium / Perceived difficulty: Medium
Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
#### Personal notes:
Simple problem in theory, took a while to get my head arround the reversed part.
### 3) Two Sum
###### Site Difficulty: Easy / Perceived difficulty: Very easy
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#### Personal notes:
Basic nested iterative issue.
### 4) Find median of two sorted arrays
###### Site Difficulty: Hard / Perceived difficulty: Medium
Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
#### Personal notes:
Simple problem in theory, mildly annoying to implement. Particularly proud of the 99th percentile memory usage and runtime.
### 5) Merge k sorted lists.
###### Site Difficulty: Hard / Perceived difficulty: Medium
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.
#### Personal notes:
I felt like using methods from previous problems to solve this one. It's solved but with abysmal runtime and memory usage.
I think I'll do this one again sometime but recursively.
